Static gallery generator. Work in progress.

TODO:
* add exclusion system;
* clean code
* add automatic generation of json config from existing directory;
* add interlaced thumbnails (formely: "add progressive loading/pages?")
* fix main page title?
* add argument system instead of constants
* add automatic creation of non-existing directories
* add sort mode option


Utilities:
* "copy_dates_to_files" was created to put original creation (or rather, modification date, due to unix limitations) into the "img/" files, to be able to sort them based chronologically
